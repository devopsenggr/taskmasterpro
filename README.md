# Ultimate DevOps Monitoring Project ðŸš€

I am thrilled to share that I have successfully implemented The Ultimate Corporate Pipeline With GitHub Actions! This project involved deploying a task master website using an Amazon EKS cluster provisioned through Terraform, with a robust CI/CD pipeline managed by GitHub Actions. It also included using Prometheus to collect rich metrics and Grafana to transform those metrics into visualizations.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Setup Repository
1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine.


### Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup
1. **Set Up Amazon EKS Cluster on AWS EC2 Instances through Terraform**
   - Provisioned an EKS cluster using Terraform.
   - Created necessary IAM roles and service accounts.
   - Generated a token for the service account.

3. **Setup SonarQube**
   - Installed and configured SonarQube for code quality analysis.
   - Configured SonarQube with the necessary project settings.


4. **Set Up GitHub Actions Self-hosted Runner on VM**
   - Configured a self-hosted runner for GitHub Actions to manage CI/CD workflows.
   - Registered the runner with the GitHub repository.

### Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline using GitHub Actions
#### Pipeline Overview
1. **Java Build and Package**
   - Set up JDK 17 using Temurin distribution.
   - Built the Java project using Maven.
   - Uploaded the generated JAR artifact as a GitHub Action artifact.


2. **Security Scans**
   - Performed file system scan using Trivy.
   - Ran SonarQube scan for code quality analysis.

3. **Docker Build and Scan**
   - Set up QEMU and Docker Buildx.
   - Built Docker image for the Java application.
   - Scanned Docker image using Trivy.
   - Logged in to Docker Hub using provided credentials.
   - Pushed the Docker image to Docker Hub.

#### Secrets Configuration
Ensure that the following secrets are configured in the GitHub repository:
- **SONAR_TOKEN:** The token for authenticating SonarQube scan.
- **SONAR_HOST_URL:** URL of the SonarQube instance.
- **DOCKERHUB_USERNAME:** Username for Docker Hub authentication.
- **DOCKERHUB_TOKEN:** Token for Docker Hub authentication.
- **KUBE_CONFIG:** Base64 encoded Kubernetes configuration file (kubeconfig) for accessing the Kubernetes cluster.

### Phase 4: Monitoring
- **System-level Monitoring**
  - CPU and RAM monitoring using `node_exporter`.
  - Configured Prometheus to scrape metrics from `node_exporter`.
